    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>TEMADES is a virtual space for new media art.</p>

    <p>Currently worked singularly by Gabriel Peredo, an engineer
      originally from the ever-promising, maybe now-delivering
      city of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdivia">
        Valdivia, Chile</a>,
      it showcases generative art works created with the
      intention of not passing off anything else, placing technique
      and the user/player/viewer both at the center.
    </p>

    <p>
      All works are guaranteed to be comprised of 100% synthetic,
      free-range game programming the likes of which has been made
      even before computers had screens. Any derivativeness of
      the resulting works is the product of
      old-fashioned lack of originality, not the fruit of AI models.
    </p>

    <h2>ART QUASI-POLITICAL GOALS</h2>
    <p>
      New media art is entering a crisis of legitimacy in two fronts,
      caused by the callousness of people engaging in it. The
      grievances against computer art are legitimate, but the onus
      is on the practicioners, not the medium itself as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the one hand is the irruption of AI art, driven by researchers
      and kleptocrats with no regard to art itself, and much less
      to artists.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an opportunistic, uncompensated upwards transfer of wealth
      that even a neoliberal shill like the self-styled director of
      TEMADES can recognize.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second front is from the nascent academic establishment
      that had worked hard to create a space for new media art,
      and that now is producing heartfelt mea-culpas for its
      entirely willing flirtations with the obvious swindles
      that were cryptocurrency-related monetization schemes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This wasn't monied power forcing its entry in any way,
      or a fundamental moral failing of computers as tools
      for art, it was the fault of people that saw an
      opportunity that didn't materialize, with no regards
      to negative outcomes to society.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rooting out this corruption can be done without discarding
      the computer as a creative medium, in fact, it should be.
